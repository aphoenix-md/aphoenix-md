Andrew Phoenix - 40ish, father of three, husband of one, President / CEO of MediaDoc.

I build sites and software on the internet. I like to use Python and TypeScript for that; I also use the standard things that one often uses, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I have been considered a "WordPress Expert", though I would not describe myself as such, mostly because of self respect.
